merge show-command

  I'm not sure about this.  Should it be --cat instead of --show?  It is
  too similar to --status below?

merge status-command

  Still needs some tests, but seems to be working nicely.  It would be
  nice to have some flags for different verbosity of output, but that
  isn't needed for the first version of this.
