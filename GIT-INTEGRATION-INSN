merge abort-dont-touch-other-branches

merge show-command

  I'm not sure about this.  Should it be --cat instead of --show?  Is it
  too similar to --status below?

merge status-command

  It would be nice to have some flags for different verbosity of output,
  but that isn't needed for the first version of this.

merge skip-option

  Needs more work to be able to handle "branch not found".

merge manpage-on-site

  WIP to improve the web site
