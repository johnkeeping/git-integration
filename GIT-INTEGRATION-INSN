merge fix-bashcomplete-not-in-repo

  Avoid an error message on stderr when using shell completion outside a
  repository.

merge remove-warning-on-create

  Suppress a shell error message that doesn't affect the code's
  behaviour but is unnecesarily scary.

merge dot-instruction

  New instruction to temporarily ignore an entry in the instruction
  sheet.

merge walk-commits-in-status

  Show the SHA-1 of the merge which brings a branch into the integration
  branch in the --status output.

  I'm not completely convinced that this is a good thing...

merge fixup-instruction

  The basic functionality is simple and working, but the --status output
  is more interesting and I'm not convinced the current heuristic is
  sufficiently robust.  The implementation in status_fixup could also
  use some refactoring.

merge skip-option

  Needs more work to be able to handle "branch not found".
