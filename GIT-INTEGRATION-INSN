merge empty-instruction

  Add an "empty" instruction to allow the insertion of empty commits to
  annotate points in an integration branch.

merge exec-instruction

  Add an "exec" instruction to permit the execution of arbitrary
  commands.

  The security aspects of this might need some more thought; perhaps the
  "exec" instruction should be disabled unless a config key is set.

. merge walk-commits-in-status

  Show the SHA-1 of the merge which brings a branch into the integration
  branch in the --status output.

  I'm not completely convinced that this is a good thing...

. merge fixup-instruction

  The basic functionality is simple and working, but the --status output
  is more interesting and I'm not convinced the current heuristic is
  sufficiently robust.  The implementation in status_fixup could also
  use some refactoring.

. merge skip-option

  Needs more work to be able to handle "branch not found".
