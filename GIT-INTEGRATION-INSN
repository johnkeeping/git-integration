merge reflog-improvments

  Improve logging of actions in the reflog.

merge prefix-option

  Add a way to apply a prefix (e.g. "origin/") to all refs in the
  instructoin sheet.

merge walk-commits-in-status

  Show the SHA-1 of the merge which brings a branch into the integration
  branch in the --status output.

  I'm not completely convinced that this is a good thing...

merge fixup-instruction

  The basic functionality is simple and working, but the --status output
  is more interesting and I'm not convinced the current heuristic is
  sufficiently robust.  The implementation in status_fixup could also
  use some refactoring.

merge skip-option

  Needs more work to be able to handle "branch not found".
