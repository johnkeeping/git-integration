merge fixup-instruction

  The basic functionality is simple and working, but the --status output
  is more interesting and I'm not convinced the current heuristic is
  sufficiently robust.  The implementation in status_fixup could also
  use some refactoring.

merge skip-option

  Needs more work to be able to handle "branch not found".
