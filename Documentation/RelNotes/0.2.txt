Git-Integration v0.2 Release Notes
==================================

Changes since v0.1
------------------

 * A new instruction "." (dot) has been added which acts to disable an
   instruction in the instruction sheet.

 * A new command-line and configuration option "prefix" has been added
   which helps when sharing instruction sheets between machines where
   all branches live under the refs/remotes/ hierarchy; users can now
   avoid writing "<remote>/" at the beginning of all refs in the
   instruction sheet by setting the prefix option to "<remote>/"
   instead.

 * Logging of git-integration actions into the reflog has been audited
   and made consistent.

 * Avoid inserting empty commits into the instruction sheet branch when
   the user closes their editor without changing the instruction sheet.

 * Check that the version of Git in use is new enough; this avoids
   cryptic errors when "git stripspace" fails in the middle of a shell
   pipeline.

Fixes since v0.1
----------------

 * Suppress a shell error message during integration branch creation
   that doesn't affect the behaviour but is unnecessarily scary.

 * Avoid using the GNU-ism "\n" in the replacement portion of sed's
   substitute command when handling the "--add" command line option.

 * Stop processing more options from the command line if an earlier one
   fails.

 * Allow the "--version" command line option to be used when
   git-integration is run outside a Git repository.

 * Don't use the bash-ism "local".

 * Various documentation formatting fixes.

Bash Completion

 * Avoid an error message on stderr when using shell completion outside
   a repository.

Tests

 * Fix tests using "wc -l" where the output format is different between
   GNU and BSD variants.
