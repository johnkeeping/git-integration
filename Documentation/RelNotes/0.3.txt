Git-Integration v0.3 Release Notes
==================================

Changes since v0.2
------------------

 * The `--cat` and `--status` command-line options can now be used while an
   integration is in progress.  There was never any particular reason to
   forbid this, they were just caught in a wide net that forbid everything
   except `--continue` and `--abort` while an integration was in progress.

 * Makefile targets have been added for building and installing HTML and .info
   format documentation.  This makes it possible to use `git help --info` and
   `git help --web` to view git-integration's documentation.
