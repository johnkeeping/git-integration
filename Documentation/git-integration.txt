==================

NAME
----
git-integration - Manage integration branches in Git

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git integration' --create <name> [<base>]
'git integration' [<action>...] [<branch>]
'git integration' (--continue | --abort)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
include::description.txt[]

OPTIONS
-------
--create::
	Create a new integration branch.  If `--edit` is also specified then
	the instruction sheet will be opened for editing.  If `--rebuild` is
	also specified then the branch will be built.
+
The name of the integration branch must be specified.  If a second positional
argument is specified then it is used as the base branch, otherwise ``master''
will be used.

--edit::
	Edit the instruction sheet for an integration branch.
+
If no branch name is specified then the current branch must be an existing
integration branch.

--rebuild::
--no-rebuild::
	Rebuild the integration branch.  The `--no-rebuild` form exists to
	suppress automatic rebuilding if the `integration.autorebuild`
	configuration variable is set.
+
If no branch name is specified then the current branch must be an existing
integration branch.

--cat::
	Print the instruction sheet for the integration branch.  If this is
	combined with options which modify the instruction sheet, then those
	operations will be performed before it is printed.

--status::
	Prints the status of the integration branch.  See the STATUS FORMAT
	section below.

--add=<branch>::
	Appends a line `merge <branch>` to the instruction list, causing that
	branch to be included in the integration branch when it is next
	rebuilt.  This option may be specified multiple times to add multiple
	branches.

--continue::
	Restart the building process after having resolved a merge conflict.

--abort::
	Abort the rebuild operation and reset HEAD to the original branch.

--autocontinue::
--no-autocontinue::
	Continues automatically if the rerere mechanism manages to resolve all
	conflicts during a merge.

--prefix=<prefix>::
	Prepend the specified string to each reference in the instruction
	sheet while building the integration branch.  For example, if you have
	pulled somebody else's instruction sheet and it references branches
	that you have fetched into the `refs/remotes/origin/` namespace, you
	can use `--prefix=origin/` to avoid needing to re-write the
	instruction sheet or import all of the refs into your local
	`refs/heads/` namespace.
+
The prefix is treated as a simple string, so you probably want to include the
trailing ``/'' if you are moving refs to a different namespace.

--version::
	Prints the version of 'git-integration' in use.

If `--continue` or `--abort` are specified then no other options may be given.
Otherwise at least one of `--create`, `--add`, `--edit`, `--cat` or
`--rebuild` must be specified.  If more than one is specified then they will
be performed in the order 'create', 'add', 'edit', 'cat', 'rebuild', 'status'.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

branch.<name>.integrationAllowExec::
	Allow the `exec` instruction to be used on integration branch
	`<name>`.

integration.allowExec::
	Allow the `exec` instruction to be used on all integration branches in
	this repository.

integration.autocontinue::
	Sets the default for the `--autocontinue` option.

integration.autorebuild::
	Automatically rebuild the integration branch after creating/editing it
	if `--no-rebuild` is not specified.

integration.prefix::
	Sets the default arguments for the `--prefix` option.

FORMAT OF INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------
The instruction sheet consists of a series of instructions which begin in
column zero, each of which may be followed by indented comments.  The
following instructions are supported:

+base+ '<ref>'::
	Resets the state of the integration branch to the specified revision.
	This should always be the first instruction in the instruction sheet,
	and should appear only at the top of the instruction sheet.

+merge+ '<ref>' '[<options>]'::
	Merges the specified ref into the integration branch.  Any comments
	following the instruction are appended to the merge commit's commit
	message.
+
If any options are given after the ref (and on the same line) then these are
passed to 'git merge'.  This may be useful for specifying an alternative merge
strategy for a branch.

+exec+ '<cmd>'::
	Executes the specified command in the shell.  If the command fails
	then the integration will stop, although it can be continued and will
	not execute the same command again.
+
For security, this command is not enabled by default.  You can enable it by
setting an appropriate Git configuration variable to `true`, either
`integration.allowExec` to enable the instruction on all integration branches
in a repository or `branch.<name>.integrationAllowExec` to enable it only for
a specific integration branch.

+.+ '<args...>'::
	Ignores this command and its description.  This can be used to remove
	a branch from the integration branch without needing to delete it and
	its description from the instruction sheet.
+
For example, if you need to remove a branch until it is in better shape but
don't want to lose track of it, you can simply add ``. '' to the beginning of
that branch's 'merge' line.

Example
~~~~~~~
------
base master

merge my-experimental-feature

  I think this is a good idea, but want to dogfood it before I
  decide whether to submit it upstream.

merge my-site-specific-changes

  Some changes to suit my environment.  DO NOT SUBMIT THESE.
------

STATUS FORMAT
-------------

Each branch included in an integration branch can have one of four states:

Merged to base::
	meaning that the branch is included in the branch on which the
	integration branch is based.  This branch can be removed from the
	integration branch's instruction sheet without changing the content of
	the branch.

Up-to-date::
	meaning that the branch is included in the integration branch but not
	in the branch on which it is based and that the integration branch
	contains all of the commits on the branch.

Out-of-date::
	meaning that the integration branch does not include all of the
	commits on the branch, because either the integration branch has not
	been rebuilt since this branch was added to its instruction sheet or
	the branch has changed since the integration branch was last built.

Not found::
	meaning that the branch specified in the instruction sheet cannot be
	found.  This may be because the branch does not exist or because it
	has been deleted for some reason.  An integration branch containing
	branches in this state cannot be rebuilt until the affected branches
	are removed from the instruction sheet.

These states are indicated by the character places before the branch, as well
as a textual indicator following the branch name:

------
+ merged-to-base  (merged to base)
* up-to-date      (up-to-date)
- out-of-date     (branch changed)
. not-found       (branch not found)
------

The status output respects the 'color.status' Git configuration variable.

SHARING INSTRUCTION SHEETS
--------------------------
The instruction sheet is just another Git branch, except that it is under
'refs/insns/' and not 'refs/heads/'.  This means that they can be shared in
the same way as other branches.

For example, to push the instruction sheet for 'pu':

	git push origin refs/insns/pu
